## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js**: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of complex interactive UIs using isolated pieces of code called components.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: An event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that's ideal for building scalable network applications. It allows for using JavaScript on the server-side, unifying web application development around a single programming language.

### Database
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database known for its high performance, high availability, and easy scalability, favoring its document-oriented model which supports a rich, dynamic schema.

## High-Level Design

### User Interaction
Users interact with the React.js-based frontend which provides a seamless and engaging user experience. Enter text prompts to generate images and explore various features like viewing past generations or sample creations.

### System Operations
Backend communication and processing are handled by Node.js, ensuring efficient, non-blocking operations when interfacing with the Stable Diffusion API and managing user-generated content.

### Data Management and Responses
User data such as prompts and images are stored in MongoDB, utilizing its schema flexibility and efficient handling of unstructured data for dynamic content creation and retrieval.
